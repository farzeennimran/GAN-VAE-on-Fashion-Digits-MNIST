# GAN and VAE on Fashion & Digits MNIST

To implement and compare different Generative AI-based anomaly detection methods in image and signal datasets. The focus will be on leveraging deep learning techniques to generate, reconstruct, and identify anomalies effectively:

1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

2. Autoencoders (AE) & Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

We will use the following datasets:

1. MNIST Digits: A dataset of handwritten digits (0-9), commonly used for classification and
generative models. Contains grayscale images (28×28 pixels).

2. MNIST Fashion: A dataset by Zalando, featuring fashion items (e.g., shirts, sneakers, and
bags).Consists of grayscale images (28×28 pixels) of 10 different clothing categories.
